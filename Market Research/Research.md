## Interviews with my cowerkers at Vala Sciences 

### If you were to buy a House right now would you want a smart thermostat or electricity monitoring system pre-installed?
No, I can install it myself
All appliances now have clocks, so it would be annoying to reset. "timer chip is the clock chip"
Ive already optimized my house 
### Are you aware of any products that monitor your electricity usage?
I have seen stuff for RVs, that monitor solar input. But not for homes. 
Upstairs and downstairs thermostats. 
### If you buy a home with traditional AC/Heater, how much would you pay to be able to control temperature/other appliances remotley 
Easy math. I would pay whatevr it costs if it's less than the money you are going to save in the future
Not interested, if I wanted to di it I would be concerned with how the data is being used  
I dont know if it would save me money 
### What information do you want to have access to? or have control over
There are security concerns, can someone else take control over your house. I would only want the information exposed locally/wifi.
### What if we told you it was safe?
Safe as in a company deals with it? because companies never leak information. UCI leaked everyones credit information in 2017 
We dont trust technology
